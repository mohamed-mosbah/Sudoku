<h1 align="center">Soduko</h1>

This is a personal Project, in which I have programmed a Soduko console game from scratch. The main purpose of this project is to practice my programming skills using C, especially working with 2D-Arrays.

# Project Description

1. The game generates new random solvable Soduko pattern for every new game.
2. The game has 4 difficulty levels. The standard difficulty level is easy. The user can change the difficulty level from the welcome screen.
3. Each user entry is shown in Green to make it easier for the user to diiferentiate between his own entries and the original ones.
4. After Successfully finishing the game, a congratulations screen is shown with the elapsed time since starting the game.
